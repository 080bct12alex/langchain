## 🚀 My Generative AI Journey: From User to Builder (with LangChain, RAG & AI Agents)

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into **Generative AI** — and it’s been an exciting and eye-opening learning experience. I didn’t just explore what it is or how it works; I actually built things using it. I focused especially on **LangChain**, **RAG applications**, and **AI Agents**, all from the **user perspective**, and also touched on the **builder side** by working on data and training a model.

Here’s what I learned:

----------

### 🧠 What I Built & Learned as a **User of Generative AI**

#### ✅ Built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) App

I learned how to connect large language models like GPT to my **own private data** using LangChain. Instead of relying on the model's built-in knowledge, the RAG setup allowed it to answer questions based on **custom documents or PDFs**.

-   Used **vector databases** to store and retrieve chunks of information
    
-   Preprocessed and embedded documents for faster and more relevant responses
    
-   Integrated LangChain pipelines to connect everything
    

> Now I can build AI systems that can answer questions about _my data_, not just general internet knowledge.

----------

#### ✅ Built AI Agents using LangChain

Using **LangChain Agents**, I built systems that could not only chat but also **take actions** based on the conversation.

-   Gave the agent tools like a search API or booking simulator
    
-   Created step-by-step workflows for tasks like booking flights or searching documents
    
-   Learned how agents decide when to call a tool, when to respond directly, and how to manage memory

### 🔧 Small but Solid Experience on the **Builder Side**

Though I focused mainly on applying models, I also spent time understanding what happens behind the scenes. I did some **basic builder-side work**, like:

-   **Cleaning and preparing datasets**
    
-   **Training a small ML model**
    
-   Exporting the model and using it in an app
    
-   Learning the basics of **pre-training vs. fine-tuning**
    
-   Understanding how foundation models are created and optimized
    

> This gave me a new appreciation for the amount of effort that goes into building the tools I use.

----------

### 🔄 How I Combined Both Worlds

One of the most valuable takeaways was realizing how **user-side and builder-side knowledge complement each other**.

-   I could clean and train my own small model (builder), then wrap it into an app and use it with LangChain (user).
    
-   This gave me full control — from raw data to usable AI application.

### 💡 Key Concepts I Now Understand

-   **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM apps
    
-   **RAG**: Technique to enhance LLMs with external/private data
    
-   **AI Agents**: LLMs that can make decisions and perform actions
    
-   **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting better instructions for better outputs
    
-   **Vector DBs**: Core of retrieval in RAG-based systems
    
-   **Preprocessing**: The essential first step in any ML pipeline
    
-   **Model Training & Deployment**: From data to a working AI

### 📈 What’s Next for Me?

Now that I’ve grasped both sides of generative AI, my next steps will be:



## 🔮 Diving into Agentic AI & LangGraph

Now that I’ve learned how to build RAG applications and use LangChain to create functional AI agents, I’m ready to take the next step — exploring **Agentic AI**, **Multi-Agent Systems**, and building intelligent agent workflows using **LangGraph**.

Here’s what I’m planning to learn next:
