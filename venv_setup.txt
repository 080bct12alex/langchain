Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Run:
python --version

If it says something like:

Run:
python --version

You should now see:
Python 3.x.x

Once Python is properly installed, try :

python -m venv .venv
This will create a .venv folder with the virtual environment.

Optional: Fix the App Execution Aliases if 
python -m venv .venv
Python was not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft Store, or disable this shortcut from Settings > Apps > Advanced app settings > App execution aliases.
