## Step-by-Step Learning Guide for Generative AI

From My  personal journey 

----------

### **1️⃣ Fast-Paced Development (Initial Challenge)**

**Problem:**  
Generative AI evolves rapidly—new tools, models, and jargon appear daily.  
**What I Felt:**

-   Overwhelmed
    
-   Unsure where to begin
    
-   Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)  
    **Tip:**
    

> Accept the noise. Instead of consuming everything, **pause and design a structured learning path**. Focus on fundamentals, not trends.

----------

### **2️⃣ Mental Model (Finding Clarity)**
To manage complexity, I began **building a mental model** to sort what matters. 
-   Identify one central idea: **"Foundation Models"**
-   Use this as a **lens** to understand everything else  
 
    

> Create a **mental filter**: When you encounter something new, ask yourself:  
> “Is this related to using a foundation model or building one?”

If you’re learning GenAI, don’t try to catch up with _everything_.  
Instead:

   Ask yourself:  
> _“Am I learning how to **use** a model, or how to **build** one?”_  
> This simplifies your direction, tooling, and next steps.

-   **Using** foundation models (as a developer, researcher, or creator)
    
-   **Building** foundation models (as a researcher, company, or advanced engineer)  
  
    **Tip:**
    -   Anchor yourself to a **central concept** (like foundation models)
    
-   Sort tools/terms by **User vs Builder**
    
-   Follow a structured path **based on your goal**



If you're thinking about starting your journey,

> **Start with the user side, get comfortable building apps, and slowly explore the builder side. Both perspectives together will make you a complete AI creator.**
